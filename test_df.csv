After a taste of this indica, the only thing you’ll be hungry for are the cold cuts in the fridge (though you may be too catatonic to get up and grab them). Heavy and lethargic, this cross between OG Kush and Blackberry has been a favorite among those suffering from muscle spasms and acute pain. Due to its strong sedative effects, don’t expect to have the energy to rampage the city.
